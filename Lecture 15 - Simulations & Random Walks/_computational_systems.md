Computational Models


Simulation Model
================
>>> Descriptive, not prescriptive
>>> Approximate reality
>>> All models are wrong, but some are useful. - George Box

1. 	Deterministic	- completely defined by model 	>> repeatability
	Stochastic		- include randomness in model 	>> non_repeatable

2. 	Static 			- accounts for the element time
	Dynamic 		- does not account for time

3. 	Discrete 		- enumerable 					>> integers
	Continuous		- not enumerable				>> real numbers
