Computational MOdels


Simulation Model
================
>>> Descriptive, not prestriptive
>>> Approximate reality
>>> All models are wrong, but some are useful. - George Box

1. 	Deterministic	- compretely defined by model 	>> repetability
	Stochastic		- include randomness in model 	>> non_repetable

2. 	Static 			- accounts for the element time
	Dynamic 		- does not account for time

3. 	Discrete 		- enumerable 					>> integers
	Continuous		- not enumerable				>> real numbers
